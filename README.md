- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HBraganza
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data, Stocks, Mechanical Engineering, AI and how to combine these.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying robotics at King's College London. I plan to learn more about AI and Machine learning. I will continue to tamper more with my stock data project when ready.
- This is my portfolio and the real time evolution of my coding abilities and experiments.
